## IIITB_RISCV_Home_Appliance_Automation_with_proximity_sensor

This Repository summarizes the work progress made in The RISC-V based project.


## Motive

The aim of this project is to create a system for automation of appliances in a home or room based on the proximity of the user. Most rooms are not equiped to automatically turn ON and OFF basic appliances like lights and fans when people enter and exit rooms respectively.This saves a lot of net electricity and helps imporve cost efficeny and power saving. Idea is not to make a home or room fully automated as of now but just to automate basic appliances.

## Requirement


## Block Diagram

## Assumed cicuit 

## Testing the code

1. Open a terminal window
2. Navigate to the directory when the .c file is present
3. Comiple the code which is designed using gcc and verify the output.

```
gcc motion.c
./a.out
```
<br />

The following ouput is observed.<br />
When input from sensor is HIGH:<br />
